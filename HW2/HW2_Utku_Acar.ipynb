    "# Accurate Housing Price Prediction with Data Cleaning and Manipulation Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're about to embark on a fascinating journey into the realm of accurate housing price prediction. Our mission revolves around overcoming the challenges posed by manipulated housing data and varying pricing practices. Through a blend of sophisticated data cleaning techniques and insightful manipulation detection, we'll develop a powerful predictive model that can provide reliable housing price estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset, named \"KonutGame.csv,\" unveils the intricate world of housing prices based on title deeds. However, the path to accuracy is fraught with obstacles. Taxes are determined by declared prices, and discrepancies can arise due to strategic pricing tactics and the influence of housing loans. Moreover, we're well aware that some individuals might sidestep the 90% housing loan regulation, further complicating the landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to engineer a methodology that accurately calculates housing prices, taking into account potential manipulations and outliers, all while adhering to the regulatory guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning and Manipulation Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to this challenge will encompass the following key phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** We will start by loading the \"KonutGame.csv\" dataset and delving into its structure and contents. An initial exploration will provide insights into the features that shape housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** We'll embark on a comprehensive data cleaning journey. This includes handling missing values, addressing outliers, and ensuring data consistency to build a robust foundation for accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manipulation Detection:** Armed with domain knowledge and analytical tools, we will unveil potential manipulations and irregularities in the housing data. By detecting instances of non-compliance with regulations and loan-pricing tactics, we'll lay the groundwork for more precise predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Predictive Model Development:** With cleaned and validated data in hand, we'll design a predictive model that captures the nuances of housing price dynamics. Our model will account for the factors affecting prices while accommodating variations and regulatory influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Evaluation and Insights:** We'll rigorously evaluate the performance of our predictive model using appropriate metrics. Through insights gained from the model's predictions, we'll gain a deeper understanding of the factors that most significantly impact housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Regulation-Aware Pricing:** Leveraging the power of our model, we'll embark on a journey to estimate accurate housing prices that adhere to regulations and detect instances where regulations are potentially circumvented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our expedition promises a thrilling fusion of data science, domain expertise, and regulatory insights. As we explore the uncharted territories of housing price prediction, we invite you to join us in this captivating adventure of unraveling manipulation, enhancing accuracy, and decoding the intricate world of housing economics."

    "\n",
    "## Loading and Handling Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial step, we begin by loading the dataset from the \"KonutGame.csv\" file using the Pandas library. The loaded data contains information about housing prices based on title deeds. By using the `read_csv` function, we create a DataFrame called `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of code, `data = pd.read_csv(\"KonutGame.csv\")`, loads the data into the DataFrame. The provided output `(17178, 9)` indicates that the dataset initially has 17,178 rows and 9 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then proceed to handle any missing values in the dataset. Missing values can potentially impact the quality of our analysis and predictions. The `dropna` function is used with the `inplace=True` parameter to remove rows with missing values from the DataFrame. This step is essential for data integrity and accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, the output `(17178, 9)` confirms that after removing the rows with missing values, the dataset remains the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing these preprocessing steps, we set the foundation for further analysis, modeling, and insights from the housing price data.\n"

    "# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code snippet, we focus on cleaning and preprocessing a housing dataset using the Pandas library. The dataset, initially stored in a DataFrame named `df_org`, contains information about various housing attributes. We create another DataFrame named `df` to work with the cleaned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning \"building_age\" and \"total_floor_count\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by defining functions to clean the \"building_age\" and \"total_floor_count\" columns. The `clean_age` function processes values in the \"building_age\" column, handling cases where values are expressed as ranges or contain \"ve üzeri\" (and above). This function ensures that numerical values are extracted and assigned appropriately to the \"building_age\" column in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clean_floor_count` function serves a similar purpose for the \"total_floor_count\" column. It processes range-based and \"ve üzeri\" values, computing a single value that represents the floor count effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning \"floor_no\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then proceeds to clean the \"floor_no\" column, which represents the floor number of each housing unit. The `clean_floor_no` function takes into account both the \"floor_no\" and \"total_floor_count\" columns to ensure accurate cleaning. It handles various cases, including garden and basement floors, special cases like \"Müstakil,\" and computes appropriate floor numbers based on the provided information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying Cleaning Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning functions are applied to the respective columns using the `apply` method. For \"building_age\" and \"total_floor_count,\" the functions are directly applied to the columns using the `apply` method. For \"floor_no,\" the `clean_floor_no` function is applied using a lambda function along with the `axis=1` parameter to work row-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this cleaning process, the DataFrame `df` is transformed to contain cleaned and standardized values for \"building_age,\" \"total_floor_count,\" and \"floor_no.\" These preprocessing steps lay the foundation for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks on the housing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stay tuned as we continue to explore and refine the data to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models for housing price estimation.\n"

    "In this section, we delve into the derivation of critical metrics related to housing attributes, specifically focusing on room count and value per room. These calculations enable us to gain insights into the housing layout and pricing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extracting Room Count from Room Count Descriptor\n",
    "\n",
    "We commence by defining a function, `extract_room_count(room_count)`, that facilitates the extraction of the number of rooms from the room count descriptor. The code `return sum(int(x) for x in room_count.split('+'))` processes the descriptor to tally the individual room numbers, generating a numerical count.\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceed to apply this function to the 'room_count' column using the code `df['room_count_num'] = df['room_count'].apply(extract_room_count)`. This application yields a new 'room_count_num' column, housing the derived room counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating Average Room Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The code `df['avg_room_size'] = df['size'] / df['room_count_num']` embarks on the calculation of the average size per room, encapsulated in the 'avg_room_size' column. The division of the total size by the room count provides us with a metric that represents the spatial extent of individual rooms within a housing unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining Value per Room\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain insights into the housing value structure, we calculate the value per room, utilizing the \"regulated_value\" and \"avg_room_size\" columns. The code `df['value_per_room_by_m2'] = df['regulated_value'] / df['avg_room_size']` computes the value attributed to each room on a per-square-meter basis, revealing a nuanced perspective on pricing distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Displaying the Enriched DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude by presenting an enriched DataFrame that encapsulates the newly calculated metrics. The code `df[['room_count', 'size', 'regulated_value', 'value_per_room_by_m2']]` offers a glimpse into the room count, total size, regulated value, and value per room metrics for each housing unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics open up avenues for understanding housing layouts, pricing dynamics, and their interplay within the context of the dataset."

    "# Corrected Prices and Normalization: Unraveling the Housing Pricing Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "In this segment, we embark on a journey of recalibrating housing prices through the lens of corrected prices, normalization, and the strategic integration of randomness. Our exploration seeks to shed light on the methodology behind each step and the rationale driving our choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Calculating Corrected Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Our voyage begins with the calculation of corrected prices, where we address pricing nuances to establish a fair and consistent pricing framework. The function `correct_price(row)` takes center stage, harnessing the district's average value per room as a starting point. By strategically introducing controlled randomness, we account for fluctuations inherent in real-world pricing. The code `return district_avg + np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)` encapsulates this process, yielding corrected prices that balance statistical insights with the unpredictability of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Normalization for Comprehensive Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization steps in as our guiding compass, enabling us to understand pricing on a holistic scale. We apply normalization to the corrected prices, factoring in the average room size. The code `df['normalized_price'] = df['corrected_price_per_room'] * df['avg_room_size']` generates normalized prices that account for variations in housing unit sizes, ensuring an even playing field for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Visualizing the Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "As we traverse through these transformations, we unveil a tableau of key metrics for visual examination. By extracting and presenting columns of interest, including \"value_per_room_by_m2,\" \"diff_from_district_avg,\" \"corrected_price_per_room,\" \"regulated_value,\" and \"normalized_price,\" we capture the essence of our journey in a succinct form. This visualization is a testament to the profound impact of data science on pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic Decision-Making: Our Guiding Light\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision in this process is a carefully considered step toward a balanced pricing paradigm. By incorporating district-level insights, calculated randomness, and normalization, we forge a path toward pricing models that echo real-world dynamics. The amalgamation of these techniques aligns with our commitment to infusing data science with strategic decision-making."

    "# Feature Selection Strategy for Dataset Split\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of predictive modeling, selecting the right set of features is akin to sculpting a masterpiece. The choices we make are a delicate interplay of context, goals, and data nuances. In this section, we delve into our thought process behind feature selection for both the cleared and uncleared datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection for Cleared Dataset (X_cleared)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`normalized_price`:** Serving as our target variable, this feature is wisely omitted from the feature set. After all, the aim is to predict it rather than include it as an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`room_count`:** The original room count feature may take a back seat here. Derived features like `avg_room_size` and `value_per_room_by_m2` seem to encapsulate the essence of room count's impact on pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`value`:** Similar to `normalized_price`, this feature is the response variable we're striving to predict. Hence, it doesn't find a place in our feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`regulated_value`:** This feature could potentially introduce data leakage due to its strong correlation with `normalized_price`. By excluding it, we maintain a cleaner predictive landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection for Uncleared Dataset (X_uncleared)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`value`:** In the uncleared dataset, this is our target variable for prediction. As a result, it gracefully steps aside from the feature ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`floor_no`:** This feature might be absent because it underwent categorical transformation in the cleared dataset. To ensure alignment, we exclude it here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`room_count`:** Similar to the cleared dataset, the original room count feature yields the spotlight to its derived counterparts, promoting coherence in our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`District` and `Neighboorhood`:** In the cleared dataset, these categorical variables metamorphosed into numerical features through one-hot encoding. Since this transformation isn't mirrored in the uncleared dataset, these features gracefully recede to maintain harmonious congruence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our selection methodology for both datasets showcases a blend of consistency, precision, and prudent exclusion. The goal is to sculpt predictive models that marry the intricacies of data with strategic decisions. As we journey forward, these choices will serve as the bedrock upon which our modeling saga unfolds.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model was applied to predict the `normalized_price` based on the provided features. The key results from the model summary are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R-squared: 0.971\n",
    "  - The R-squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (`normalized_price`) that is explained by the independent variables in the model. In this case, the R-squared value of 0.971 indicates that approximately 97.1% of the variance in the `normalized_price` can be explained by the selected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- F-statistic: 4.494e+04\n",
    "  - The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model. A high F-statistic indicates that at least one of the predictor variables significantly contributes to explaining the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- P-values and Coefficients:\n",
    "  - Each predictor variable's coefficient represents the change in the predicted `normalized_price` for a one-unit change in the predictor variable while keeping other variables constant.\n",
    "  - The P-value associated with each coefficient tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (i.e., the variable has no impact on the outcome). A low P-value (usually less than 0.05) suggests that the predictor variable is statistically significant in predicting the `normalized_price`.\n",
    "  - For example, the coefficient for the `size` variable is approximately 398.2325. This means that for each additional unit increase in the `size` of a property, the predicted `normalized_price` is expected to increase by around 398.23 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the model's R-squared value suggests that the selected features collectively provide a strong fit to the data. The significance of individual predictor variables is determined by their associated P-values. The coefficients provide insights into the direction and magnitude of the relationships between the predictor variables and the predicted `normalized_price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Importance and Uniqueness Analysis\n",

    "1. `building_age`\n",
    "   - Coefficient: 115.5670\n",
    "   - P-value: < 0.001\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `building_age` has a coefficient of 115.5670. This indicates that for each year increase in the building's age, the predicted `normalized_price` is expected to increase by approximately 115.57 units. The low p-value (< 0.001) suggests that this feature is statistically significant and has a strong impact on predicting housing prices.\n",

    "2. `total_floor_count`\n",
    "   - Coefficient: -60.8528\n",
    "   - P-value: 0.198\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `total_floor_count` has a coefficient of -60.8528. This suggests that an increase in the total floor count is associated with a decrease in the predicted `normalized_price` by approximately 60.85 units. However, the relatively higher p-value (0.198) implies that this relationship might not be statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `floor_no`\n",
    "   - Coefficient: 11.5196\n",
    "   - P-value: 0.850\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `floor_no` has a coefficient of 11.5196. This indicates that the specific floor number might have a negligible impact on the predicted `normalized_price`, as the coefficient is relatively low. Additionally, the high p-value (0.850) suggests that this feature is likely not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `size`\n",
    "   - Coefficient: 398.1804\n",
    "   - P-value: < 0.001\n",

    "   - P-value: < 0.001\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `District` has a coefficient of 367.8988. This indicates that properties located in different districts have varying impacts on the predicted `normalized_price`. The low p-value (< 0.001) suggests that this categorical feature significantly contributes to predicting housing prices.\n",

    "   - P-value: 0.001\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `Neighboorhood` has a coefficient of 4.9669. This implies that different neighborhoods can have a slight impact on the predicted `normalized_price`. The low p-value (0.001) suggests that this feature is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Coefficient: 0.0121\n",
    "   - P-value: < 0.001\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `mortgage` has a coefficient of 0.0121. This indicates that for each unit increase in the mortgage value, the predicted `normalized_price` is expected to increase by approximately 0.0121 units. The low p-value (< 0.001) signifies the statistical significance of this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `ninetyreg`\n",
    "   - Coefficient: -2444.5204\n",
    "   - P-value: < 0.001\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `ninetyreg` has a coefficient of -2444.5204. This suggests that properties subject to the 90% regulation have a significant impact on predicting housing prices. The low p-value (< 0.001) indicates strong statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `room_count_num`\n",
    "   - Coefficient: -1.062e+04\n",
    "   - P-value: < 0.001\n",
    "   - Interpretation: The feature `room_count_num` has a coefficient of -1.062e+04. This implies that for each increase in the number of rooms, the predicted `normalized_price` is expected to decrease by a considerable amount. The low p-value (< 0.001) reflects the statistical significance of this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `avg_room_size`\n",
    "    - Coefficient: 9405.4157\n",
    "    - P-value: < 0.001\n",
    "    - Interpretation: The feature `avg_room_size` has a coefficient of 9405.4157. This indicates that for each increase in the average room size, the predicted `normalized_price` is expected to increase by around 9405 units. The low p-value (< 0.001) signifies the strong statistical significance of this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, several features such as `building_age`, `size`, `District`, `mortgage`, `ninetyreg`, `room_count_num`, and `avg_room_size` exhibit strong statistical significance and contribute significantly to predicting housing prices. The impact of other features, such as `total_floor_count` and `floor_no`, might be less pronounced based on their relatively higher p-values.\n"

The associated probability (Prob (F-statistic)) is extremely close to 0, indicating that the overall model is statistically significant. This suggests that at least one of the predictor variables has a significant impact on the target variable.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tale of Cleared Data\n",
    "The model trained on the refined, cleared data unfolds as a harmonious composition. With an impressive R-squared value of 0.971, the model encapsulates nearly 97.1% of the variance in normalized housing prices. The F-statistic, a testament to the model's overall significance, emerges at a staggering 4.494e+04. This ensemble of metrics illustrates the adeptness of cleared data in articulating the variance within our target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual contributors to this symphony, our predictor variables, step onto the stage with significance. Building age, size, district, neighborhood, mortgage, ninetyreg, room count, and average room size join the ensemble, each playing a role in shaping the orchestration of predictions. As we examine the t-values and p-values, we observe a compelling narrative. Building age, size, district, neighborhood, mortgage, ninetyreg, and average room size stand as stalwart features, their p-values painting a picture of statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Story of Uncleared Data\n",
    "On the other hand, the uncleared data paints a different narrative. With an R-squared value of 0.505, this dataset reveals a distinct reality—approximately 50.5% of the variability in housing prices is captured. The accompanying F-statistic of 4374 underlines the collective robustness of the model. However, the relatively lower R-squared value can be attributed to the necessary omission of certain features to facilitate the processing of uncleared data. This subtly implies that the dropped features hold a meaningful role in uncovering the genuine prices of the apartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we dissect the roles of the individual features, building age, total floor count, size, and mortgage take the spotlight. Each comes forward with their coefficients and significance. The t-values and p-values unveil a mixed landscape—a landscape where building age, total floor count, size, and mortgage wield statistical significance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we have found how much data clearance and feature engineering contribute to the success of data analysis and processing, once again."
